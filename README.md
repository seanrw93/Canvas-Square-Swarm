# Interactive Features:
## 1. Mouse Inflation

When you move your mouse cursor near the squares, they will inflate in size. The closer your mouse is to the square, the larger it will become. As the squares move away from the mouse, they revert back to their original size. This creates a fascinating effect as the squares dynamically respond to your mouse movements.
## 2. Click and Drag Attraction

By clicking and dragging on the canvas, you can attract the nearby squares to the coordinates of your mouse. The squares will follow your mouse cursor as you move it around the canvas. This interaction allows you to create captivating patterns and shapes with the squares.
## 3. Touch support

If you're using a touch-enabled device, the animation responds to touch commands. Place your finger near the squares to trigger inflation, and touch and drag to attract the squares as you move your finger across the canvas.
